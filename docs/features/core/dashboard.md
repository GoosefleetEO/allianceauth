# Dashboard

The dashboard is the main page of the **Alliance Auth** website and the first page every logged in user will see.

The content of the dashboard is specific to the logged in user. It has a sidebar, which will display the list of apps a user currently as access to based on his permissions. And it also shows which character the user has registered and to which group he belongs.

For admin users the dashboard shows additional technical information about the  AA instance.
